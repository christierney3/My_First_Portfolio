In this homework we were tasked with creating our own portfolio website from scratch. In the HTML file I layed out the groundwork for the website with different sections for the about me, nav bar, projects, and contact links.
After the layout was formed I used the css file to style it and use flexbox to organize the material in a presentable fashion.
